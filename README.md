# 3.1: Phonebook backend step 1

In part0 there is a statement like this:

A system for detecting plagiarism is used to check exercises submitted to GitHub. If code is found from model answers or multiple students hand in the same code, the situation is handled according to the policy on plagiarism of the University of Helsinki.

Therefore, my desire to write original code causes me to go a little beyond what is required in the exercises. In 3.1 I skipped the request in Exercise 1 to display the requested contact list in json format on the server page. However, there was also concern about not being able to pass the task. That's why I wanted to send this as an extra.
