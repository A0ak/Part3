# 3.13-3.14: Phonebook database, step1-step2


I couldn't solve a problem with the deletion process. The contacts I delete from the database are deleted on my home page and server page without any problems. But there is a problem when deleting from the home page. I tried to solve this problem for 3-4 nights, I couldn't overcome it and decided to do other tasks. I work in a bookstore during the day. I can find time at night to learn software. I believe I could solve this problem if I didn't have to work during the day.
